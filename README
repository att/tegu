Tegu is a middle layer that provides the outside world with an interface to the 
skoogi enhanced, floodlight (or other) SDN controllers.  Tegu also, as a side effect
provides a request interface that yields a complete network graph (as described
by floodlight), and the ability to map an IP address, VM name or VM ID to a 
switch port combination. 

The tegu src is divided into two packages and the main:
	managers -- functions that are driven as goroutines and thus implement
				major components of the application (reservation manager,
				fq manager, etc.).  

	gizmos	--  source files which implement objects, interfaces and the 
				functions that operate directly on them (link, host, switch, 
				pledge, etc.).

	main	--  The main 

		

Build tegu by:
	1) cd main
	2) go build tegu.go


Gizmos:
	globals.go		constants and a few globals shared by *.go in this directory
					This module also contains the initialisation function that 
					sets all globals up. 

	flight_if.go	floodlight interface providing methods that allow queries to the 
					controller for gathering link and host information. 

	host.go			represents a single host in the network graph and in a path

	link.go			represents a link between switches in the network graph and in a path

	obligation.go	used to manage an obligation of something over time; references may time slices

	path.go			manages a path that has been created with a given amout of bandwith

	pledge.go		used by res_mgr to track reservations in it's inventory

	queue.go   		manages information needed to set individual queues for a reservation

	spq.go      	a very simple object which allows the return of queue information to a caller in 
					a single bundle (presently, just the struct, no functions exist).
	switch.go		represents a switch in the network graph

	time_slice.go	a single range of time for which a given amount of bandwith has been allocated

	tools.go		some generic tools but not generic enough to prompte to the forge packages

Managers:
	http_api.go		provides the http "rest-ish" interface
	network.go		manages the network graph
	res_mgr.go		provides the resevation management logic
	osif.go			openstack interface manager.
	fqmgr.go		flowmod/queue manager


Testing
	tegu_test.go	run 'go -v test'  to run the tests


The tegu source depends on a set of Go packages that were developed along side Tegu, 
but are general enough to warrent their not being included here.  They are all a part
of the forge.research.att.com/gopkgs/* package library.  To use them, clone the git 
project and put it in the go source tree under  forge.research.att.com/gopkgs/. Unfortunately, 
the Research forge Git isn't organised such that using Go's nice clone feature works 
cleanly, so make the upper directory, and clone the gopkgs project into it.
